# pytorch-tensorboard-demo
Demonstration of using tensorboardX in a PyTorch experiment. [The PyTorch official Transfer learning tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html) has been used as the base. 

The experiment description is available at my [blog post](https://naadispeaks.wordpress.com/2019/05/27/tensorboard-with-pytorch/).
